Task
Write a function that takes a non-empty array and returns a quadruple* that matches a targeted sum. The order of returned quadruples does not matter. If no array is found that matches the target sum, return an empty array. Feel free to use any programming language.

Function Signature:

Array<Array<number>> function(Array<number> inputArray, int targetSum) {
                        // your code goes here
}

Sample Input:

inputArray = [7,6,4,-1,1,2]
targetSum = 16

Sample Output:

[[7,6,4,-1], [7,6,1,2]]

* quadruple is an array that contains only 4 elements
